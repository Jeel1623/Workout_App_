Magic Fitness is a simple Flutter app that helps users track their workout sessions.
Users can add, edit, and delete workout records, including details like weight lifted and repetitions performed.
The app is built using the BLoC architecture for clean code separation and uses Hive for fast, lightweight data storage.
Itâ€™s a basic project for learning purposes and not intended for commercial use.
